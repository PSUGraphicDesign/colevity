# CoLevity

> A debut web presence for Portland-based performing arts group _CoLevity_

## Getting Started

You'll need to add two environment-specific files to your project. Please request them from a project administrator.

To launch the app, navigate to its root folder in the terminalâ€¦

```sh
cd /path/to/the/project
```

Then, use PHP's Simple Server to launch the app:

```sh
php -S localhost:8000
```

PHP will let you know the server has started normally. Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000` and check it out!

Requests for `colevity.css` will fail until the Sass stylesheets are compiled.

Switch to the `assets` folder, then use Sass's `watch` command:

```sh
cd assets
sass --watch sass/colevity.sass:css/colevity.css
```
